Each of us makes a character, and then plays as that character. To describe what that character is good at (and not good at) we use points systems like the one described below. More \"dots\" mean your character is good at something, less dots means they aren't as practiced, and no dots means they simply have never tried."},

Like the other theological virtues, hope is an infused virtue. It is not, like good habits in general, the outcome of repeated acts or the product of our own industry. Hope is bestowed by God at baptism."},
                {"p":"In the Christian tradition, hope in Christ and faith in Christ are closely linked, with hope having a connotation that means the one with hope has a firm assurance, through the witness of the Holy Spirit, that Christ has promised a better world to those who are His. The Christian sees death not just as the end of a passing life, but as the gateway to a future life without end and in all fullness. Pope Benedict XVI states: 'Whoever believes in Christ has a future. For God has no desire for what is withered, dead, ersatz, and finally discarded: he wants what is fruitful and alive, he wants life in its fullness and he gives us life in its fullness'"},
                {"p":"Hope can thus sustain one through trials of faith, human tragedies or difficulties that may otherwise seem overwhelming. Hope is seen as 'an anchor of the soul' as referenced in the Epistle to the Hebrews of the New Testament. Hebrews 7:19 also describes the 'better hope' of the New Covenant in Christ rather than the Old Covenant of the Jewish law."},
                {"p":"Hope is opposed to the sins of despair and presumption; refraining from them is adhering to the negative precept of hope. The positive precept is required when exercising some duties, as in prayer or penance."},

It is a cardinal virtue, which is to say that it is 'pivotal', because it regulates all such relationships, and is sometimes deemed the most important of the cardinal virtues."},

Aristotle developed the idea of equity to cover irregular cases so that 'the ordinance is framed to fit the circumstances'."},

                {"p":"In Christian moral theology, Justice is a quality or habit which perfects the will and inclines it to render to each and to all what belongs to them. The object of the virtue of justice is the other person's rights, whether natural or bestowed by Church or State. Justice requires that all persons should be left in the free enjoyment of all their rights. The rights which belong to every human being inasmuch as he is a person are absolute and inalienable."},
                {"p":"In Aristotle's wake, Thomas Aquinas developed a theory of proportional reciprocity, whereby the just man renders to each and all what is due to them in due proportion: what it is their moral and legal rights to do, possess, or exact.

                {"p":"Prudence (Latin: prudentia, contracted from providentia meaning 'seeing ahead, sagacity') is the ability to govern and discipline oneself by the use of reason. It is classically considered to be a virtue, and in particular one of the four Cardinal virtues (which are, with the three theological virtues, part of the seven virtues). Prudentia is an allegorical female personification of the virtue, whose attributes are a mirror and snake, who is frequently depicted as a pair with Justitia, the Roman goddess of Justice."},
                {"p":"The word derives from the 14th-century Old French word prudence, which, in turn, derives from the Latin prudentia meaning 'foresight, sagacity'. It is often associated with wisdom, insight, and knowledge. In this case, the virtue is the ability to judge between virtuous and vicious actions, not only in a general sense, but with regard to appropriate actions at a given time and place. Although prudence itself does not perform any actions, and is concerned solely with knowledge, all virtues had to be regulated by it. Distinguishing when acts are courageous, as opposed to reckless or cowardly, is an act of prudence, and for this reason it is classified as a cardinal (pivotal) virtue."},
                {"p":"In modern English, the word has become increasingly synonymous with cautiousness. In this sense, prudence names a reluctance to take risks, which remains a virtue with respect to unnecessary risks, but, when unreasonably extended into over-cautiousness, can become the vice of cowardice."},
                {"p":"In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle gives a lengthy account of the virtue phronesis (Ancient Greek: ϕρόνησις), traditionally translated as 'prudence', although this has become increasingly problematic as the word has fallen out of common usage. More recently ϕρόνησις has been translated by such terms as 'practical wisdom', 'practical judgment' or 'rational choice'."},
                {"p":"Prudence was considered by the ancient Greeks and later on by Christian philosophers, most notably Thomas Aquinas, as the cause, measure and form of all virtues. It is considered to be the auriga virtutum or the charioteer of the virtues."},
                {"p":"It is the cause in the sense that the virtues, which are defined to be the 'perfected ability' of man as a spiritual person (spiritual personhood in the classical western understanding means having intelligence and free will), achieve their 'perfection' only when they are founded upon prudence, that is to say upon the perfected ability to make right decisions. For instance, a person can live temperance when he has acquired the habit of deciding correctly the actions to take in response to his instinctual cravings."},
                {"p":"The function of a prudence is to point out which course of action is to be taken in any concrete circumstances. It has nothing to do with directly willing the good it discerns. Prudence has a directive capacity with regard to the other virtues. It lights the way and measures the arena for their exercise. Without prudence, bravery becomes foolhardiness; mercy sinks into weakness, free self-expression and kindness into censure, humility into degradation and arrogance, selflessness into corruption, and temperance into fanaticism. Culture and disciplined actions should be about the beneficial action. Its office is to determine for each in practice those circumstances of time, place, manner, etc. which should be observed, and which the Scholastics comprise under the term 'medium rationis'. So it is that while it qualifies the intellect and not the will, it is nevertheless rightly styled a moral virtue.[2]"},
                {"p":"Prudence is considered the measure of moral virtues since it provides a model of ethically good actions. 'The work of art is true and real by its correspondence with the pattern of its prototype in the mind of the artist. In similar fashion, the free activity of man is good by its correspondence with the pattern of prudence.' (Josef Pieper) For instance, a stockbroker using his experience and all the data available to him decides that it is beneficial to sell stock A at 2PM tomorrow and buy stock B today. The content of the decision (e.g., the stock, amount, time, and means) is the product of an act of prudence, while the actual carrying out of the decision may involve other virtues like fortitude (doing it in spite of fear of failure) and justice (doing his job well out of justice to his company and his family). The actual act's 'goodness' is measured against that original decision made through prudence."},
                {"p":"In Greek and Scholastic philosophy, 'form' is the specific characteristic of a thing that makes it what it is. With this language, prudence confers upon other virtues the form of its inner essence; that is, its specific character as a virtue. For instance, not all acts of telling the truth are considered good, considered as done with the virtue of honesty. What makes telling the truth a virtue is whether it is done with prudence."},

The Christian understanding of the world includes the existence of God, the natural law and moral implications of human actions. In this context, prudence is different from cunning in that it takes into account the supernatural good. For instance, the decision of persecuted Christians to be martyred rather than deny their faith is considered prudent."},

                {"p":"Malicious envy is similar to jealousy in that they both feel discontent towards someone's traits, status, abilities, or rewards. A difference is that the envious also desire the entity and covet it. Envy can be directly related to the Ten Commandments, specifically, 'Neither shall you covet ... anything that belongs to your neighbour'—a statement that may also be related to greed. Dante defined envy as 'a desire to deprive other men of theirs'. In Dante's Purgatory, the punishment for the envious is to have their eyes sewn shut with wire because they gained sinful pleasure from seeing others brought low. According to St. Thomas Aquinas, the struggle aroused by envy has three stages: during the first stage, the envious person attempts to lower another's reputation; in the middle stage, the envious person receives either 'joy at another's misfortune' (if he succeeds in defaming the other person) or 'grief at another's prosperity' (if he fails); the third stage is hatred because 'sorrow causes hatred'."},

                {"p":"Gluttony (Latin, gula) is the overindulgence and overconsumption of anything to the point of waste. The word derives from the Latin gluttire, meaning to gulp down or swallow. In Christianity, it is considered a sin if the excessive desire for food causes it to be withheld from the needy. Because of these scripts, gluttony can be interpreted as selfishness; essentially placing concern with one's own impulses or interests above the well-being or interests of others. During times of famine, war, and similar periods when food is scarce, it is possible for one to indirectly kill other people through starvation just by eating too much or even too soon. Medieval church leaders (e.g., Thomas Aquinas) took a more expansive view of gluttony,[27] arguing that it could also include an obsessive anticipation of meals, and the constant eating of delicacies and excessively costly foods.[28] Aquinas went so far as to prepare a list of five ways to commit gluttony, comprising:"},

                {"p":"Ardenter – eating too eagerly"},
                {"p":"Of these, ardenter is often considered the most serious, since it is extreme attachment to the pleasure of mere eating, which can make the committer eat impulsively; absolutely and without qualification live merely to eat and drink; lose attachment to health-related, social, intellectual, and spiritual pleasures; and lose proper judgement: an example is Esau selling his birthright for ordinary food of bread and pottage of lentils. His punishment was that of the 'profane person ... who, for a morsel of meat sold his birthright'. We learn that 'he found no place for repentance, though he sought it carefully, with tears'."},

It is usually thought of as intense or unbridled sexual desire, which leads to fornication, adultery, rape, bestiality, un-natural sexual practices and other immoral sexual acts. However, lust could also mean simply desire in general; thus, lust for money, power, and other things are sinful. In accordance with the words of Henry Edward Manning, the impurity of lust transforms one into 'a slave of the devil'. Lust, if not managed properly, can subvert propriety."},

However, greed (as seen by the Church) is applied to an artificial, rapacious desire and pursuit of material possessions. Thomas Aquinas wrote, 'Greed is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things.' In Dante's Purgatory, the penitents are bound and laid face down on the ground for having concentrated excessively on earthly thoughts. Hoarding of materials or objects, theft and robbery, especially by means of violence, trickery, or manipulation of authority are all actions that may be inspired by greed. Such misdeeds can include simony, where one attempts to purchase or sell sacraments, including Holy Orders and, therefore, positions of authority in the Church hierarchy. As defined outside Christian writings, greed is an inordinate desire to acquire or possess more than one needs, especially with respect to material wealth.

This sense of hubris could also characterize rape. Aristotle defined hubris as shaming the victim, not because of anything that happened to the committer or might happen to the committer, but merely for the committer's own gratification.

As one might expect, pride is not always associated with high self-esteem but with highly fluctuating or variable self-esteem.

In other words, the modern definition may be thought of as, 'that pride that goes just before the fall.' In his two-volume biography of Adolf Hitler, historian Ian Kershaw uses both 'hubris' and 'nemesis' as titles. The first volume, Hubris, describes Hitler's early life and rise to political power.

And they are usually thieves, but only steal from those who have too much. "},
                {"h3":"Grizzled Worker"},
                {"p":"Another very common trope, this character works at some difficult and demanding job, and is a hard case with a sour attitude. Typically very no-nonsense, but can be softened up by displays of skill and fortitude. The 'Work' can be anything, even things like doctoring or soldiering."},
                {"h3":"Manic Pixie Dream Girl"},
                {"p":"Doesn't necessarily have to be a girl, but this trope is another loud one. High energy, bouncy, fun, carefree...  all to excess and to everyone's detriment. Usually used as a plot device to contrast a despondent main character, but can be solo too. "},
                {"h3":"White Knight"},
                {"p":"This ones contested, by lemme spin it anyways. We have this ultra-virtuous paragon warrior who always takes up the cause of those whom they perceive as their lessers, usually pretending that there's no reward expected, but will get hella bent out of shape if the reward is missing. May be money, or fame, or sex, or just a legit 'Thank you'. Is probably an otherwise cool guy too."},
                {"h3":"Socialite Spy/Diplomat"},
                {"p":"The epitome of Social Combat, this character slides in and out of expensive and high class situations, full of fame and intrigue, and does typically uncouth things for advance the agenda of their nation, company, or selves. "},
                {"h3":"Feral Child / Couch Potato"},
                {"p":"A mashup, cuz we can do that. This character is completely zeroed out in the social graces, and only lives to meet their basic requirements. Could be Survival heavy, like the kid literally raised by wolves. Might be the shut-in bookworm, who refuses anything other than porridge and a book. Might be that 12yo playing fortnight 18 hours a day screaming at Bitch Mommy to hurry up with the r/tendies, hunny mussie, and dewey.  In any form, this character is focused on fairly pathetic forms of self-gratification, and little else."},
                {"p":"Pairs well with White Knight and The Victim."},
                {"h3":"The Victim"},
                {"p":"This character may have a shit spread of shit stats, or be fairly well set up. Usually has a high Manipulation at least. They just whine and moan about every trouble, projecting their failures onto others or circumstances. Typically this is paired with some kind of inferiority complex, in that they will actively avoid situations where they may fail. You know, so that way its not their fault, and they can continue to need rescuing. "},
                {"h3":"Healer"},
                {"p":"This character is the sort of soft-bleeding-hearted character that's in damn near every IP that wants to save the world using compassion and kindness. And not violence. They got Medicine and Heal and are usually broke and wise and somewhat useless. "}
