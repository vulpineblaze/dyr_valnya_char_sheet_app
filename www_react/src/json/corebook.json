Each of us makes a character, and then plays as that character. To describe what that character is good at (and not good at) we use points systems like the one described below. More \"dots\" mean your character is good at something, less dots means they aren't as practiced, and no dots means they simply have never tried."},
                {"p":"A point in any character trait is called a \"dot\". Dots are on your character sheet. Rolls are made with a d12, 9 thru 12 are successes, and 12s are re-rolled. One's cancel out successes. The number of relevant dots determine how many d12's are rolled."},
